I'm a senior emerging techs leader, designing disruptive concepts (“The future of mobility”, “The world in 2036”, “Future soldiers”, “The Farm of the Future”) and turning these concepts into POCs and MVPs based on AI.

On AI, I excel on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision. 
My toolbox contains Python, Scikit Learn, Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch.
I have a  dev-ops mindset (Agile, CI/CD, Terraform, Ansible, Git) and I like to build Cloud architecteures to support my AI models, mostly on AWS and Azure.

I have an entrepreneurial mindset (I was CTO of a start-up) and I am an AI enthusiast
