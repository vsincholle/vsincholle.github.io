I'm a senior emerging techs leader who designs disruptive concepts and turns these concepts into POCs and MVPs based on AI.
I work for several domains, such as Automotive, Defence&Space, Agriculture and leads design sessions around following disruptive concepts:
“The future of mobility”, “The world in 2036”, “Future soldiers”, “The Farm of the Future”,..

All of these concepts led to several MVPs based on AI.
I excel on Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision using Python, Scikit Learn, Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch.
All of my projects are deployed on the Cloud, I got some skills on AWS and Azure and I love dev-ops & automation (Agile, CI/CD, Terraform, Ansible, Git).

I have an entrepreneurial mindset and I love working on projects together, so feel free to reach out for collaboration!
