  <br/>
I’m a senior emerging techs leader, experienced in designing MVPs around Cloud (AWS, Azure) and AI (Python, Scikit Learn, Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch). <br/>
I teach AI at a university for engineering students and I love sharing my knowledge and speaking at events and conferences around AI and emerging technologies. <br/>
So feel free to reach out for collaboration!<br/>

  <h2>My background</h2>
After being graduated of Ecole polytechnique and obtaining a Ph.D in Innovation Management, I worked 10 years for Thales group's corporate research center, 
being responsible for developing new areas and leading innovation.<br/>
Then, I headed the Data & Design Lab, a department dedicated to exploring emerging technologies for Neovia group, particularly in Data Science
and Artificial Intelligence. During this time, I got the fantastic opportunit to develop an entrepreneurial adventure for Neovia: I funded a data start-up and took the CTO position.<br/>
Now I work for ADM, a multinational food processing and commodities trading corporation, where I lead the Digital Lab, a department
dedicated on digital technologies and artificial intelligence.<br/>

  <h2>My way of working</h2>
I love applying design thinking and lean startup approaches to my projects. For me everything start with the customer point-of-view, 
even more when we talk about artificial intelligence. My way to work is exploring innovation fields such as “The future of mobility”, “The world in 2036”, “Future soldiers”, “The Farm of the Future” and proposing new concepts based on emerging techs and how they could disrupt business models of the companies. 
Some of such concepts are presented in the portfolio part of this site.<br/>
