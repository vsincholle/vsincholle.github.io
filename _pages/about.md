I'm a senior emerging techs leader, experienced in Cloud (AWS, Azure) and AI (Python, Scikit Learn, Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch). 

I specialize in machine learning/deep learning techniques and how to deploy AI algos into the Cloud following dev-ops (Agile, CI/CD, Terraform, Git). 
I teach AI at a university for engineering students too and I love sharing my knowledge or speaking at conferences about new techs.

I'm used to follow design approach on my projects. Leading design workshops to generate ideas and protoype MVPs based on AI.
I had experience on Automotive, Space & Defence and Agriculture domains where I explored some disruptive concepts such as “The future of mobility”, “The world in 2036”, “Future soldiers”, “The Farm of the Future”,..

I have an entrepreneurial mindset and I love working on projects together, so feel free to reach out for collaboration!
