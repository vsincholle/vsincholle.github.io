## Predict users behaviors by analyzing product recommendations

### Goal of the project
Peopleâ€™s tastes and preferences are naturally going to change over time and it is very important for a company to follow product recommendations given by customers on ecommerce platforms. The goal of the project was to analyze these recommendations in order to learn more customers behavior and to be able to predict what their preferences are.

### My Role
I developped the AI algorithm to predict users behaviors.
My concept was to collect product recommendations, to do some text recognition on each comment, then to do some knowledge discovery (meaning to try quantifying the notion of information contained) and by the end to do some classification to obtain users groups. Once a user belong to a group we could predict what could be the next interesting products for him.
I used Cloud cognitive services to do the text reognition part and then some machine learning etchniques to build the classifier.
The model was trained on several hundreds of recommendations coming from an ecommerce platform.

### A POC to understand how AI could change the game
This product was not launched on the market. 
The objective was just to promote AI internally and to show to the marketing teams of this company how product recommendations could be an interesting way to predict users behaviors.
