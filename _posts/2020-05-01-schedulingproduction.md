## Acidosis diagnosis for dairy cow farmers

### Goal of the project
In this project, we designed and developed a mobile application to help dairy cow farmers against acidosis.
This desease has a huge impact on milking performance for cows and so a huge economic impact for the farmers.
Old-fashion way is to analyse each dung manually  but it is very long and not so pleasant, so many farmers don't go for it.

### my Role
In order to do that, we built a product team to invent a new solution. 
I was the tech leader for all the project: leading the tech team, designing the global architecture and validating all the technical steps.
My concept was to use image recognition by shooting dungs with a smartphone camera. 
Images will be send to a back-end on the cloud containing both an API and an AI model.
I designed the cloud architecture and developed the deep learning algorithm for the image recognition part.
The model was trained on several thousands of images which were labelled by experts.

### A product daily used by farmers over the world
Our solution is better than human prediction. 
It was launched as a mobile app, called myRumidiag, on the Apple store and the Google playstore
Our product won a French-Tech award: the first prize on Agreen proto, the 21th November 2018.

This application is used by several farmers daily on many countries in EMEA and Latin America. 
Very proud to help worlwide farmers to fight against this desease :)
