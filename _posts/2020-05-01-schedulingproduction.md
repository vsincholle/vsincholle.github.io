## Optimizing the production scheduling for a Food & Beverage company 

### Goal of the project
In this project, we designed and developed a web application to help production scheduling.
Production manager receive orders comming from SAP system and he need to better schedule how these orders will be produced on the different production lines.
A system exists to do that but only on the downstream part of the process and it no takes into account the upstream units, where some bottlenecks exist.
The goal of the project is to develop a very light tool, extracting data from SAP and scheduling all the units of the different production lines of the plant.

### My Role
My first mission was to develop a POC on a single production line to check if it is possible to improve the scheduling.
In order to do this POC, I went to the plant and organize a design workshop to better understands needs of different stakeholders. 
This tool should be used by different persons inside the company (supply chain planner, production manager, production scheduler, operators, etc.).
Based on these requirements, I developed the POC in 6 weeks and we had some good results on this line so we decided to continue by building a product team.
The goal of the product team was to extend the POC to all the production lines and the complexity appears. It takes several months to deliver a full MVP working on the plant. During all the project, I was in charge of the technical team, designing the global architecture, designing the technical strategy and roadmap, validating all the technical steps.

### An operationnal tool for production managers and operators
Today our solution is daily used by operators of the plant and help the to increase OEE. 
The company ask us to extend this tool to others locations.
