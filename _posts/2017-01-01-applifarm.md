## Create the future of farming through an open platform for data sharing

### Goal of the project
I designed the concept of an open platform for data sharing in the livestock sector. 
This platform will use various sources of data (management, feed, dairy operations, livestock advice, breeding, performance tracking, sanitary advice, etc.) in order to help companies in the ruminant sector to create new services for livestock breeders.
This idea was too large for Neovia in terms of data and business model, so we decided with the CEO and the R&D Director of Neovia to find other companies who could be interested by the concept.
Neovia built a partnerhsip with other companies such as Evolution, BCEL Ouest, GDS Bretagne, Eilyps, Cogedis and Adisseo to create the start-up company Applifarm.

### My Role
I took the CTO position inside the start-up and I was in charge of the development of all the technical aspects 
(Leading the technical team, Identifying cloud providers and building partnerships, Designing the Big Data architecture, Leading the Platform development, 
Managing the technical budget). Team size was 14 people. I built a partnership with a Cloud key player to develop the Infrastructure. 

### An entreprenuerial adventure and 
This project was developed in intrapreneurship during more than one year and then become an independent company.
When the start-up was launched, I left my CTO position to continue working at Neovia as Emerging Tech Leader and take a seat on the board of the start-up as 
Scientific advisor.
