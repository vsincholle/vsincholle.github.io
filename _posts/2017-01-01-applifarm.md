## Create the future of farming through an open platform for data sharing

### Goal of the project
I designed the concept of an open platform for data sharing in the livestock sector. 
This platform will use various sources of data (management, feed, dairy operations, livestock advice, breeding, performance tracking, sanitary advice, etc.) in order to help companies in the ruminant sector to create new services for livestock breeders.

This idea was too large for Neovia in terms of data and business model, so we decided with the CEO and the R&D Director of Neovia to find other companies who could be interested by the concept.
Neovia built a partnerhsip with other companies such as Evolution, BCEL Ouest, GDS Bretagne, Eilyps, Cogedis and Adisseo to create the start-up company Applifarm.

### My Role
I took the CTO position inside the start-up and I was in charge of the development of all the technical aspects 
(Leading the technical team, Identifying cloud providers and building partnerships, Designing the Big Data architecture, Leading the Platform development, 
Managing the technical budget). Team size was 14 people. I built a partnership with a Cloud key player to develop the Infrastructure.

### A fantastic adventure 
This project was developed in intrapreneurship during more than one year and then become an independent company.
When the start-up was launched officially, we recruit more than 10 people to take our positions and I left my CTO position to continue working at Neovia.
I took a seat at the board of the start-up as Scientific advisor.

Applifarm won the Innov'Space (prize for innovation on agriculture domain) in 2018.

This experience was one of the best I had the opportunity to live, meaning giving life to an idea coming from my brain and turning it into a business from A to Z.
It convinces me that entrepreneurial adventures are very important to grow. 
Since this experience, I try to live each project as this one, meaning be around good energy, connect with people and end-users, learn new things and try to transform business through emerging technologies.
