## Improving customer experience with chatbots

### Goal of the project
In this project, we would like to see how we could increase the customer experience by using chatbots for a Nutrition company.
The scenario was to help customer to order a product. The chatbot asks some questions to the customer to recommend him the best product and based on the quantity desired by the customer, it will provide a delivery date.

### my Role
In order to do that, we built a product team to invent a new solution. 
I was the tech leader for all the project: leading the tech team, designing the global architecture and validating all the technical steps.
My concept was to use image recognition by shooting dungs with a smartphone camera. 
Images will be send to a back-end on the cloud containing both an API and an AI model.
I designed the cloud architecture and developed the deep learning algorithm for the image recognition part.
The model was trained on several thousands of images which were labelled by experts.
