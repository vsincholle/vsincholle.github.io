## Improving customer experience with chatbots

### Goal of the project
In this project, we would like to see how we could increase the customer experience by using chatbots for a Nutrition company.
The scenario was to help customer to order a product. The chatbot asks some questions to the customer to recommend him the best product and based on the quantity desired by the customer, it provides a delivery date.

### My Role
My concept was to use cloud service to deliver this POC. Most of the cloud providers provide cognitive services now.
We used the AWS ones, using AWS Lex which allows to do automatic speech recognition (ASR) for converting speech to text and natural language understanding (NLU) to recognize the intent of the text.
As it was a POC, we worked on a light mode, only 2 people team.
I did the cloud part and the chatbot programming on AWS and the second developer did the UI of the mobile app.

### A rapid prototype to show how interactions could be changed
This product was not launched on the market. The objective was just to promote AI internally and to show to the marketing teams of this company how interactions could be easily improved on the future using new technologies and chatbots.
